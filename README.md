## User Story
This is a interface used to help someone traveling. 
As a User, I want to enter the zip code of my destination on a submit form and get the name and address of a brewery.
As a User, I want the nearest hotel to that brewery to also load on the website. 

## Description

This application was built working together as a group of 4. We first discovered 2 different APIs to work cohesively. The first is a brewery api that finds us a brewery in a selected zip code. We then use the lat & lon of this brewery on a hotel booking api. The hotel api finds us the nearest hotel possible. The following image shows a returned search.

We used JavaScript to dynamically update our HTML. This is shown in the following photo of code. It shows how we get the data from the api, then apply it in a stylized way to our page. We set attributes as well as appened it. Foundation is used in the HTML to help give our page a structure and assist our CSS in styling.
